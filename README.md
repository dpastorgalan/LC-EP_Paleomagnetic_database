# Late Carboniferous - Early Permian Paleomagnetic database

This repository contains a database with Late Carboniferous and Early Permian palepoles from Europe and North America.

## 1 Rationale
Following structure, petrology, geochronology and sedimentology a large collision involving Gondwana, Laurussia, and some other microplates happened during the Late Paleozoic. In Europe most geological arguments suggest the main collisional events end at around 330 or 320 million years ago (Ma hereafter) where Pangea was mostly formed. In North America the main collisional event seems to end slightly later, at about 310-300 Ma.

In contrast the Late Carboniferous and Early Permian paleomagnetic database of the world shows potential tectonic problems. Whereas the paleomagnetic database suggest large overlaps and important tectonic movements. The main pitfall is the scarcity of data. Here I have compiled a comprehensive database including paleomagnetic data from Europe and North America. This compilation is by no means a final project but will grow with time and new datasets. I am more than happy to add all datasets you know but I haven't included yet.
